## getOnboardingResponses

```swift
let responses = RampKit.getOnboardingResponses()
```

Returns an array of all user responses collected during onboarding flows. Responses are automatically saved when users answer questions and persist across app launches.

## Usage

```swift
let responses = RampKit.getOnboardingResponses()

for response in responses {
    print("Question: \(response.questionId)")
    print("Answer: \(response.answer.value)")
    print("Question Text: \(response.questionText ?? "N/A")")
    print("Screen: \(response.screenName ?? "N/A")")
    print("Answered at: \(response.answeredAt)")
}
```

## OnboardingResponse Structure

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `questionId` | `String` | Unique identifier for the question |
| `answer` | `AnyCodable` | The user's answer (any JSON-compatible value) |
| `questionText` | `String?` | Optional question text shown to user |
| `screenName` | `String?` | Screen where question was answered |
| `answeredAt` | `String` | ISO 8601 timestamp when answered |

## Notes

- Responses are stored in the device Keychain for security and persistence
- If the same question is answered multiple times, only the latest answer is kept
- Responses are automatically cleared when `reset()` is called
- Returns an empty array if no responses have been collected
