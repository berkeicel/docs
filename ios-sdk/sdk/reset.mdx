## reset

```swift
await RampKitCore.shared.reset()
```

Clears all cached state, user data, and session information, then re-initializes the SDK with the original configuration.

### When to Use

Call `reset()` when:
- A user logs out of your app
- You need to switch between user accounts
- You want to clear all onboarding progress and start fresh

### What Gets Reset

- User ID and device info
- Session data
- Event tracking state (EventManager)
- Onboarding data cache
- Transaction observer
- Any displayed overlays or loading views

### Example

```swift
import RampKit

// When user logs out
func handleLogout() async {
    // Reset RampKit state and re-initialize
    await RampKitCore.shared.reset()

    // Continue with your logout flow
    await signOut()
}
```

### Notes

- The SDK will automatically re-initialize after reset using the original configuration passed to `initialize(config:)`
- If `initialize()` was never called, `reset()` will log a warning and return without action
- After reset, a new user ID will be generated and a fresh session will start
- Requires iOS 14.0+ / macOS 11.0+
