## getAnswers

```swift
let answers = RampKit.shared.getAnswers()
```

Returns a dictionary containing all user answers collected during onboarding. Answers are automatically saved when users interact with onboarding screens and persist across app launches.

## Usage

```swift
// Get all answers
let answers = RampKit.shared.getAnswers()
print(answers)
// ["userGender": "Male", "healthGoal": "Lose Weight", "age": "25-34", ...]

// Access specific values
if let goal = answers["healthGoal"] as? String {
    print("Goal: \(goal)")
}
```

## getAnswer

Get a single answer by key:

```swift
let goal = RampKit.shared.getAnswer("healthGoal")
// Optional("Lose Weight")

let gender = RampKit.shared.getAnswer("userGender") as? String
// "Male"
```

## Return Type

```swift
// getAnswers returns:
[String: Any]

// getAnswer returns:
Any? // nil if key doesn't exist
```

## Example Response

```swift
[
    "userGender": "Male",
    "userDiet": "No restrictions",
    "age": "25-34",
    "healthGoal": "Lose Weight",
    "checkProductLabels": "Sometimes",
    "hasHealthConditions": false
]
```

## Notes

- Answers are stored in the device Keychain for security and persistence
- Answers are initialized with default values when onboarding starts
- Updates are saved automatically as users interact with onboarding screens
- Answers are automatically cleared when `reset()` is called
- Returns an empty dictionary `[:]` if no answers have been collected
