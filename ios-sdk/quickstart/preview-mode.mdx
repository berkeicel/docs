## Preview mode

Use preview mode to load draft flows on your device or simulator.

```swift
import RampKit
RampKit.enableDebug(previewMode: true)
```

Then, in the RampKit dashboard:

- Select a draft flow
- Click “Preview on device”
- Scan the QR code or copy the session code

Your device or simulator will pull the latest draft content without publishing.
