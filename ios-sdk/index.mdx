## iOS SDK

RampKit for iOS helps you ship native onboarding, paywalls, and growth flows that you can update from the web without new releases.

### What you'll build

- Initialize the SDK with your API key
- Load and present your first flow
- Send user attributes for targeting
- Enable preview mode during development

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15+
- iOS 14+
- Swift 5.7+ (Swift and Objective‑C are both supported)
