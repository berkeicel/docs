## Variables and state

Use variables to personalize flows on iOS. Values are synced from the app to RampKit and referenced in the builder.

Set user attributes at runtime:

```swift
RampKit.setUserAttributes([
  "plan": "pro",
  "country": "US",
  "daysSinceInstall": 3
])
```

Read variables inside your app:

```swift
let headline = RampKit.variable("paywallHeadline") ?? "Upgrade"
let cta = RampKit.variable("primaryCta") ?? "Continue"
```
