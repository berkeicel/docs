## Bridge communication

Exchange data between your app and RampKit to power dynamic experiences.

- Send context in real time via `setUserAttributes`
- Read variables to adapt UI around the flow
- Subscribe to events to react to user actions

```swift
RampKit.setUserAttributes(["balance": 25.0, "currency": "USD"])

let title = RampKit.variable("paywallTitle") ?? "Go Pro"

RampKit.onEvent { event in
  if event.type == .flowCompleted {
    // Unlock feature
    FeatureFlags.shared.set("pro", enabled: true)
  }
}
```
