## Actions and events

Capture user interactions and trigger navigation or updates in response. Subscribe to SDK events to observe flow lifecycle and user actions.

```swift
RampKit.onEvent { event in
  switch event.type {
  case .flowStarted:
    print("Flow started: \(event.flowId ?? "")")
  case .screenShown:
    print("Screen: \(event.screenId ?? "")")
  case .purchaseCompleted:
    // Forward to analytics
    Analytics.track("purchase_completed", properties: event.properties)
  default:
    break
  }
}
```
