## Flows and screens

RampKit orchestrates native iOS screens to present your configured flows. Each flow is a sequence of screens (welcome, feature highlights, paywall, success, etc.) defined in the dashboard.

- Flows are resolved server‑side based on targeting rules and user attributes
- Screens are rendered natively for performance and accessibility
- You can start a flow at a specific screen using `startScreenId`

Example:

```swift
RampKit.showOnboarding(flowId: "onboarding_v2", startScreenId: "paywall")
```
