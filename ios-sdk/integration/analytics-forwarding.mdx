## Analytics forwarding

Forward events to tools like Amplitude or Segment using `forwardEvents` or in your own event callback.

Segment:

```swift
RampKit.forwardEvents(to: .segment)
```

Amplitude (custom):

```swift
RampKit.onEvent { event in
  Amplitude.instance().logEvent(event.type.rawValue, withEventProperties: event.properties)
}
```
