## Key Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Completion Rate** | Completed / Started |
| **Drop-off Rate** | Abandoned by screen |
| **Time to Complete** | Average seconds |
| **Notification Opt-in** | Granted / Prompted |
| **Trial Start Rate** | Trials / Completed |
| **Purchase Rate** | Purchases / Completed |

## Quick Wins

### 1. Track Everything

```typescript
import { RampKit, eventManager } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

// Custom conversion events
RampKit.trackEvent("trial_started", { plan: "premium" });
RampKit.trackEvent("feature_activated", { feature: "dark_mode" });
```

### 2. Forward to Analytics

```typescript
const originalTrack = eventManager.track.bind(eventManager);
eventManager.track = async (eventName, props, ctx) => {
  await originalTrack(eventName, props, ctx);
  amplitude.track(eventName, { ...props, variant: ctx?.variantId });
};
```

### 3. Run A/B Tests

Create variants in the dashboard and track:

```typescript
// Variant info is automatically included in events
// Dashboard shows conversion per variant
```

### 4. Analyze Drop-offs

```typescript
// onboarding_abandoned includes:
{
  lastScreenName: "screen_pricing",
  reason: "dismissed",
  timeSpentSeconds: 45
}
```
