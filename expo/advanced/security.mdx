RampKit is designed with security in mind. This guide covers security considerations for your integration.

## Data Security

### Secure User ID Storage

User IDs are stored securely:
- **iOS**: Keychain Services
- **Android**: EncryptedSharedPreferences

```typescript
// User ID is generated and stored securely
const userId = await getRampKitUserId();
// Stored in: iOS Keychain / Android EncryptedSharedPreferences
```

### Data Transmission

All data is transmitted over HTTPS:
- Events sent to RampKit backend via HTTPS
- Onboarding manifest fetched from CDN over HTTPS
- TLS 1.2+ required

## API Key Security

### Keep Keys Private

Never commit API keys to version control:

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded in code
await RampKit.init({ appId: "app_abc123xyz" });

// ✅ Better: Environment variables
await RampKit.init({ appId: process.env.RAMPKIT_APP_ID });

// ✅ Best: Expo config or secrets management
import Constants from "expo-constants";
await RampKit.init({ appId: Constants.expoConfig.extra.rampkitAppId });
```

### Expo Configuration

```javascript
// app.config.js
export default {
  extra: {
    rampkitAppId: process.env.RAMPKIT_APP_ID,
  },
};
```

## WebView Security

### Content Security

The SDK applies hardening scripts to WebViews:
- Disables text selection
- Prevents zoom/pinch gestures
- Blocks context menus
- Prevents drag operations

### Script Injection

Only trusted scripts are injected:
- Variable synchronization handlers
- Button animation scripts
- No external script loading (except specified in your onboarding)

## Event Data

### What's Collected

The SDK collects and sends:
- Device info (platform, model, locale)
- Session data (launch count, timestamps)
- Event data (screen views, taps, completion)
- User ID (generated, not personal)

### What's NOT Collected

- Personal information (unless you include it in events)
- Location data
- Contact information
- Photos or files

## Best Practices

<Tip>

**Do:**
- Use environment variables for app IDs
- Enable HTTPS for any external scripts
- Review onboarding content for sensitive data
- Use secure paywall integrations (RevenueCat, etc.)

**Don't:**
- Include personal data in event properties
- Hardcode API keys in source code
- Disable WebView security features
- Trust user input without validation

</Tip>

## Compliance

### GDPR Considerations

- User IDs are pseudonymous
- Device info is used for personalization
- Events can be opted out by not calling `init()`

### App Store Compliance

- SDK follows iOS App Store guidelines
- No hidden data collection
- Transparent analytics usage

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
- Email: security@rampkit.com
- Do not disclose publicly until addressed
- We'll respond within 48 hours
