Use RampKit's analytics to understand how users move through your onboarding.

## Automatic Tracking

The SDK tracks:

| Event | Data |
|-------|------|
| `onboarding_started` | Flow ID, total steps |
| `onboarding_screen_viewed` | Screen ID, index |
| `onboarding_completed` | Time to complete, steps |
| `onboarding_abandoned` | Reason, last screen |
| `notifications_response` | Permission status |
| `purchase_completed` | Product, amount |

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Completion Rate** | Completed / Started |
| **Drop-off Rate** | Abandoned by screen |
| **Time to Complete** | Average seconds |
| **Notification Opt-in** | Granted / Prompted |
| **Purchase Rate** | Purchases / Completed |

## Custom Events

Track additional conversion points:

```typescript
// Track trial start
RampKit.trackEvent("trial_started", { plan: "premium" });

// Track feature activation
RampKit.trackEvent("feature_activated", { feature: "dark_mode" });
```

## Forward to Analytics

```typescript
import { eventManager } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

const originalTrack = eventManager.track.bind(eventManager);
eventManager.track = async (eventName, properties, context) => {
  await originalTrack(eventName, properties, context);
  myAnalytics.track(eventName, properties);
};
```

<Tip>
Use the RampKit dashboard to visualize funnels and identify drop-off points.
