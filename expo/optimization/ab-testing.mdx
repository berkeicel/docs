RampKit supports A/B testing for onboarding flows. Test different designs to optimize conversion.

## How It Works

1. Create variants in the RampKit dashboard
2. SDK assigns users to variants automatically
3. Track completion and conversion events
4. Analyze results in the dashboard

## Variant Assignment

Users are automatically assigned to variants:
- **Deterministic** — Same user always sees same variant
- **Persistent** — Survives app restarts
- **Balanced** — Even distribution

## Tracking

All events include variant context automatically:

```typescript
// Events include context.flowId and context.variantId
```

## Forward to Analytics

Include variant info in your analytics:

```typescript
import { eventManager } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

const originalTrack = eventManager.track.bind(eventManager);
eventManager.track = async (eventName, properties, context) => {
  await originalTrack(eventName, properties, context);
  
  myAnalytics.track(eventName, {
    ...properties,
    variant_id: context?.variantId,
  });
};
```

## Key Metrics

Track per variant:
- Onboarding completion rate
- Drop-off by screen
- Notification opt-in rate
- Purchase conversion rate

<Tip>
- Test one thing at a time
- Run tests for at least 7 days
- Aim for 1,000+ users per variant
</Tip>
