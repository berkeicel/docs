## getOnboardingResponses

```typescript
const responses = await RampKit.getOnboardingResponses();
```

Returns a promise that resolves to an array of all user responses collected during onboarding flows. Responses are automatically saved when users answer questions and persist across app launches.

## Usage

```typescript
const responses = await RampKit.getOnboardingResponses();

for (const response of responses) {
  console.log("Question:", response.questionId);
  console.log("Answer:", response.answer);
  console.log("Question Text:", response.questionText ?? "N/A");
  console.log("Screen:", response.screenName ?? "N/A");
  console.log("Answered at:", response.answeredAt);
}
```

## OnboardingResponse Type

```typescript
interface OnboardingResponse {
  questionId: string;
  answer: any;
  questionText?: string;
  screenName?: string;
  answeredAt: string;
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `questionId` | `string` | Unique identifier for the question |
| `answer` | `any` | The user's answer (any JSON-serializable value) |
| `questionText` | `string?` | Optional question text shown to user |
| `screenName` | `string?` | Screen where question was answered |
| `answeredAt` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp when answered |

## Notes

- Responses are stored using native secure storage (Keychain on iOS, SharedPreferences on Android)
- If the same question is answered multiple times, only the latest answer is kept
- Responses are automatically cleared when `reset()` is called
- Returns an empty array if no responses have been collected
