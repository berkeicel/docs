## reset

```typescript
await RampKit.reset();
```

Clears all cached state, user data, and session information, then re-initializes the SDK with the original configuration.

### When to Use

Call `reset()` when:
- A user logs out of your app
- You need to switch between user accounts
- You want to clear all onboarding progress and start fresh

### What Gets Reset

- User ID and device info
- Session data
- Event tracking state
- Onboarding data cache
- Transaction observer

### Example

```typescript
import { RampKit } from "@anthropic/rampkit-expo";

// When user logs out
async function handleLogout() {
  // Reset RampKit state and re-initialize
  await RampKit.reset();

  // Continue with your logout flow
  await signOut();
}
```

### Notes

- The SDK will automatically re-initialize after reset using the original configuration passed to `init()`
- If `init()` was never called, `reset()` will log a warning and return without action
- After reset, a new user ID will be generated and a fresh session will start
