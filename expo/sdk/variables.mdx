title: "RampKit.getVariables() / setVariable(key, value)"
description: "Read or update runtime variables shared between SDK and WebViews"
---

```ts
const vars = RampKit.getVariables();
console.log(vars.currentStep); // e.g. "question_3"

RampKit.setVariable("goal", "lose_weight");
```

**Notes**

- Variables persist across screens within a flow
- Changing variables in native code immediately updates the web layer
- Use variables for conditional logic in your editor (e.g., showing different screens based on goal)
