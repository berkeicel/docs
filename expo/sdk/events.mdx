RampKit includes comprehensive event tracking. Events are sent to the RampKit backend and can be forwarded to your analytics provider.

## Automatic Events

These events are tracked automatically:

### App Lifecycle

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `app_session_started` | App launched |
| `app_backgrounded` | App went to background |
| `app_foregrounded` | App came to foreground |

### Onboarding

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onboarding_started` | Onboarding overlay shown |
| `onboarding_screen_viewed` | Screen displayed |
| `onboarding_completed` | User finished all screens |
| `onboarding_abandoned` | User closed early |

### Notifications

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `notifications_prompt_shown` | Permission dialog shown |
| `notifications_response` | User responded to permission |

### Purchases

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `purchase_started` | Purchase initiated |
| `purchase_completed` | Purchase successful |
| `purchase_failed` | Purchase failed |

## Manual Event Tracking

### Track Custom Event

```typescript
RampKit.trackEvent("custom_action", {
  buttonId: "cta_upgrade",
  screen: "pricing",
  value: 29.99,
});
```

### Track Screen View

```typescript
RampKit.trackScreenView("profile_settings", "home");
// Parameters: screenName, referrer (optional)
```

### Track CTA Tap

```typescript
RampKit.trackCtaTap("upgrade_button", "Upgrade to Pro");
// Parameters: buttonId, buttonText (optional)
```

## Event Manager Access

For advanced use cases:

```typescript
import { eventManager } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

// Track paywall events
eventManager.trackPaywallShown("paywall_main", "onboarding");
eventManager.trackPaywallPrimaryActionTap("paywall_main", "pro_monthly");
eventManager.trackPaywallClosed("paywall_main", "purchased");
```

## Event Forwarding

Forward events to your analytics provider:

```typescript
import { eventManager } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

const originalTrack = eventManager.track.bind(eventManager);

eventManager.track = async (eventName, properties, context) => {
  // Send to RampKit backend
  await originalTrack(eventName, properties, context);
  
  // Forward to your analytics
  myAnalytics.track(eventName, properties);
};
```

<Tip>
All events are sent as "fire and forget" — they don't block your app's main thread.
