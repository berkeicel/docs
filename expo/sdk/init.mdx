title: "RampKit.init(config)"
description: "Initializes the SDK. Call once before any other method"
---

RampKit is a lightweight singleton SDK. Once initialized, it can be accessed from anywhere in your app.

Initializes the SDK. Must be called once before any other method. Handles environment setup, analytics registration, and caching.

```ts
import { RampKit } from "rampkit-expo";

RampKit.init({
  apiKey: "YOUR_PROJECT_KEY",
  environment: __DEV__ ? "sandbox" : "production",
  cacheEnabled: true,
  logLevel: "warn",
});
```

**Parameters**

- **apiKey** — required
- **environment** — "sandbox" or "production"
- **cacheEnabled** — boolean (optional) — Enables client-side caching of flows
- **logLevel** — "silent", "warn", or "debug" — Controls verbosity of logs

**Notes**

- Call `RampKit.init()` before rendering any screens.
- Safe to call multiple times — the SDK ignores reinitialization.
