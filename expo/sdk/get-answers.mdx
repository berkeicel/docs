## getAnswers

```typescript
const answers = await RampKit.getAnswers();
```

Returns a promise that resolves to an object containing all user answers collected during onboarding. Answers are automatically saved when users interact with onboarding screens and persist across app launches.

## Usage

```typescript
// Get all answers
const answers = await RampKit.getAnswers();
console.log(answers);
// { userGender: "Male", healthGoal: "Lose Weight", age: "25-34", ... }

// Access specific values
console.log("Goal:", answers.healthGoal);
console.log("Gender:", answers.userGender);
```

## getAnswer

Get a single answer by key:

```typescript
const goal = await RampKit.getAnswer("healthGoal");
// "Lose Weight"

const gender = await RampKit.getAnswer("userGender");
// "Male"
```

## Return Type

```typescript
// getAnswers returns:
Record<string, any>

// getAnswer returns:
any // or undefined if key doesn't exist
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "userGender": "Male",
  "userDiet": "No restrictions",
  "age": "25-34",
  "healthGoal": "Lose Weight",
  "checkProductLabels": "Sometimes",
  "hasHealthConditions": false
}
```

## Notes

- Answers are stored using native secure storage (Keychain on iOS, encrypted storage on Android)
- Answers are initialized with default values when onboarding starts
- Updates are saved automatically as users interact with onboarding screens
- Answers are automatically cleared when `reset()` is called
- Returns an empty object `{}` if no answers have been collected
