RampKit works with both Expo and React Native. Install with npm or yarn:

```bash
# Expo
npm install rampkit-expo

# or React Native (bare)
npm install rampkit-react-native
```

If you’re using Expo, no additional native configuration is needed.

For bare React Native, run:

```bash
npx pod-install
```
