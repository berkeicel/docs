To render a live onboarding:

```ts
await RampKit.loadFlow("onboarding_main", {
  onComplete: () => {
    navigation.replace("Home");
  },
  onExit: () => {
    console.log("User exited onboarding");
  },
});
```

You can load flows from anywhere — it’s a single line, no wrapper components required.
