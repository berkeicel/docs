After initialization, showing an onboarding flow is a single line of code:

```typescript
RampKit.showOnboarding();
```

The SDK automatically loads your onboarding configuration from the RampKit dashboard and renders it in a native WebView overlay.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { Button, View } from "react-native";
import { RampKit } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    RampKit.init({
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      onOnboardingFinished: (payload) => {
        console.log("User completed onboarding:", payload);
        // Navigate to main app
      },
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <Button 
        title="Start Onboarding" 
        onPress={() => RampKit.showOnboarding()} 
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## With Inline Callbacks

You can pass callbacks directly to `showOnboarding()`:

```typescript
RampKit.showOnboarding({
  onShowPaywall: (payload) => {
    // Handle paywall display (e.g., RevenueCat integration)
    console.log("Show paywall:", payload);
  },
});
```

## Closing the Onboarding

To programmatically close the onboarding overlay:

```typescript
RampKit.closeOnboarding();
```

This triggers the abandonment tracking and gracefully dismisses the overlay.

## How It Works

When you call `showOnboarding()`, the SDK:

1. **Builds WebView screens** — Converts your onboarding data into optimized HTML/CSS/JS
2. **Injects device context** — Template variables like `${device.platform}` are resolved
3. **Renders in a PagerView** — Native swipe navigation between screens
4. **Tracks analytics** — Onboarding start, screen views, completion, and abandonment
5. **Handles interactions** — Button taps, haptic feedback, and navigation
6. **Syncs variables** — State is shared across all screens in real-time

## Event Tracking

The SDK automatically tracks these events during onboarding:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onboarding_started` | When the overlay appears |
| `onboarding_screen_viewed` | Each screen view with index and ID |
| `onboarding_completed` | When user finishes all screens |
| `onboarding_abandoned` | When user closes early |
| `notifications_prompt_shown` | When permission prompt appears |
| `notifications_response` | User's notification permission response |

<Tip>
Use the RampKit dashboard to view analytics and A/B test different onboarding flows.
