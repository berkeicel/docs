RampKit fetches your published onboarding configuration from the CDN. During development, you can test changes before publishing.

## Development Environment

Use the `development` environment to enable additional logging:

```typescript
RampKit.init({
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  environment: "development",
});
```

In development mode, the SDK logs:

- Initialization steps
- Device info collection
- Onboarding data loading
- Event tracking
- Variable updates

## Debug Console

Enable verbose logging to debug issues:

```typescript
// All RampKit logs are prefixed with [RampKit]
// Use React Native's console filtering to show only RampKit logs
```

Example log output:

```
[RampKit] Init: Collecting device info...
[RampKit] Init: userId rk_abc123...
[RampKit] Init: Sending user data to backend...
[RampKit] Init: Initializing event manager...
[RampKit] Init: Starting transaction observer...
[RampKit] Init: Fetching manifest from https://...
[RampKit] Init: Using onboarding Main Onboarding flow_123
[RampKit] Init: Onboarding loaded
[RampKit] ShowOnboarding: context present
[RampKit] EventManager: Event sent: onboarding_started
```

## Testing Different Onboardings

Your manifest can contain multiple onboarding flows. Currently, the SDK uses the first onboarding in the list. Configure your priority in the RampKit dashboard.

## Device Context Testing

Test template variable resolution by checking the device context:

```typescript
import { buildRampKitContext, collectDeviceInfo } from "rampkit-expo-dev";

async function debugContext() {
  const deviceInfo = await collectDeviceInfo();
  const context = buildRampKitContext(deviceInfo);
  
  console.log("Device context:", context.device);
  console.log("User context:", context.user);
}
```

This shows what values your templates will resolve to:

```javascript
{
  device: {
    platform: "iOS",
    model: "iPhone 15 Pro",
    locale: "en_US",
    language: "en",
    country: "US",
    currencyCode: "USD",
    currencySymbol: "$",
    appVersion: "1.0.0",
    buildNumber: "1",
    interfaceStyle: "dark",
    timezone: -25200,
    daysSinceInstall: 3
  },
  user: {
    id: "rk_abc123...",
    isNewUser: false,
    hasAppleSearchAdsAttribution: false,
    sessionId: "session_xyz...",
    installedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Always test on real devices before publishing. Simulator/emulator behavior may differ for haptics, notifications, and purchases.
