Initialization should happen once at app startup, ideally in your `App.tsx` or `index.js`:

```ts
import { RampKit } from "rampkit-expo";

RampKit.init({
  apiKey: "YOUR_PROJECT_KEY",
  environment: "production", // or 'sandbox'
});
```

RampKit automatically handles caching and analytics once initialized. If you need to test a draft flow, use:

```ts
RampKit.setPreviewKey("YOUR_PREVIEW_TOKEN");
```
